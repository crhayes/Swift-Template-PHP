## PHP Template Inheritance (PHP 5)

This class provides View/Template rendering support in pure PHP. It allows templates to utilize inheritance so that the logic dictating the construction of the final view is left to the view itself, instead of the controller where it doesn't belong.

## Example

See the `example/index.php` file for a look at how easy it is to use. If you wish to learn more about the basic concepts of template inheritance visit <http://phpti.com>.
